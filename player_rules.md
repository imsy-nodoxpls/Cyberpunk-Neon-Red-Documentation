# Neon Red Player Rules
## CHARACTER
### Character Creation
Each player has access to **3 character slots**. Thus, you can only have a maximum of 3 characters at a time.
* You must use Complete Package to create a character. Use standard 62 STAT points [PG. 78].
* Streetrat and Edgerunner character generation is **banned**.
* Running Out of Cash? [PG. 118] option is banned
* During your Lifepath, you may **choose** to have up to 3 Friends and/or up to 3 Enemies [PG. 51] instead of rolling. You may also choose from the Friend/Enemy table instead of rolling.

After that, just submit the character through the **Character Submission (Chargen)** option in the #tickets channel of the discord server for review. Once approved, you are ready to play. **You can only submit one character at a time. Please wait for 2 days after your character is approved before (re)submitting a new one unless your character dies in the meantime**.

### Character Resubmit
* **Regular Resubmit**: You may resubmit your character up to a maximum of 3 times as long as you completed no more than 5 jobs. Resubmitting allows you to respec your character and still keep your job rewards (which are applied only after the character is re-approved, not during creation).
* **Special Resubmit**: Resubmits given out as a result of rules changes. These often come with conditions attached.
* You cannot respec out of a role (any any ranks in that role) if you have spent DTDs on a service or invention involving that role.

### Character Retirement or Death
If your character retires after a job or dies during a job, your share of the rewards for that job is transferred to the next character you make (rewards are applied after the character is approved).

## GAMEPLAY
**WARNING: “Playtest Rules” can be Changed or Removed anytime in the future!**

### Armor Penalty
**[Playtest Rule]**
Armor no longer penalizes DEX or REF. It instead penalizes MOVE and Evasion.

| Armor            | Evasion Penalty | MOVE Penalty |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Medium Armorjack | -2              | N/A          |
| Heavy Armorjack  | -2              | -1           |
| Flak             | -4              | -1           |
| Metal Gear       | -4              | -1           |

### Armor and Health (SP and HP)
Your HP and Armor SP are fully restored for free at the end of each job. The same goes for the HP of Bulletproof Shields.

### Critical Injuries
Critical injuries persist between jobs and during downtime unless you pay the appropriate hospital fees **[PG. 225]** which then cures the appropriate injuries. A Medtech PC can also attempt to cure critical injuries of others. Characters of the same player cannot help each other. If the Medtech fails, the critical injury can only be fixed by going to a hospital.

### Cyberware
* **Enhanced Antibodies**: Since everyone heals full HP after every job, Enhanced Antibodies give +2 to any First Aid, Paramedic, or Surgery Checks made on the person with this cyberware.

### Complementary Skills
One Complementary Skill Check can be made per Skill Check. You can do this for downtime rolls without extra DTD cost. **DV for the Complementary Check is the same as the main Check**. If you succeed, you can add a +1 to the main Check. Here are some Complementary Skills for downtime when no GM can adjudicate. During a game, the GM chooses the Complementary Skill and DV.

| Skill                    | Complementary Skills   | Skill        | Complementary Skills               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Basic Tech               | Electronics/Security   | Demolitions  | Science (Chemistry or Physics)     |
| Cybertech                | Electronics/Security   | First Aid    | Paramedic or Surgery               |
| Electronics/Security     | Basic Tech             | Medical Tech | Paramedic or Science               |
| Vehicle Tech             | Any other Vehicle Tech | Paramedic    | First Aid or Surgery               |
| Weaponstech              | Basic Tech             | Surgery      | Paramedic                          |
| Basic Tech (Drug/Poison) | Science (Chemistry)    | Trading      | Business, Persuasion or Streetwise |

### Downtime
Each month you pay for Lifestyle and Housing (your first month is paid for free during chargen), you get a base **28 Downtime Days (DTD) + bonus/penalty based on housing**. You don’t get DTDs if you are living on the street. DTDs can be saved up across multiple months. Medias get additional DTD = their Credibility rank that can only be used on screamsheets and are lost if not used that month. You may spend DTDs on a variety of actions such as:

* **Hustle**: In exchange for 7 DTDs, you may roll for The Hustle [PG. 381] one time.
* **Therapy**: In exchange for 7 DTDs, you may undergo therapy [PG. 229] or assist with therapy (if you are a Medtech) once. Medtechs cannot provide therapy to themselves.
* **Repair/Upgrade/Fabricate/Invent**: 1 DTD represents 1 day of work.
* 1 DTD = 12 hours for downtime activities that take less than 1 day.
* **Services** cost 1 DTD per day of work. Services that take less than 1 day still cost 1 DTD. It is the minimum DTD cost for a service.
* **Sourcing/Selling** gear doesn’t cost any DTD unless it's a service, in which case it costs 1 DTD per transaction. Fixer deal’s cost no additional DTD.
* Any downtime activity performed by the Exec’s NPC teammates uses up the Exec’s DTD.
